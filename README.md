# Mothball
The most up to date Discord bot for simulating Minecraft movement to high accuracy, used for parkour among other minecraft fields of research involving movement. This is the desktop application version. Credits to [CyrenArkade](https://github.com/CyrenArkade/mothball) for making the original mothball. For the up to date discord bot Mothball, see the main branch [here](https://github.com/anon-noob/mothball).

## Function Syntax
Functions must be separated by spaces. They consist of the function name, optionally followed by arguments in parenthesis. Args must be separated by commas.

### Functions
Movement names are generally of the format `[stop, sneak, walk, sprint]`​`[air, jump]`​`[45]`.  
These can be shortened down to `[st, sn, w, s]`​`[a, j]`​`[45]`.

Exceptions include the strafe sprintjump variants, which are prefixed with `[l, r]`.

#### Player Functions:

|--------------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| xb           |           | centered  | Outputs the player's x position in blocks jumped           |
| zb           |           | centered  | Outputs the player's z position in blocks jumped           |
| outx         |           | centered  | Outputs the player's x displacement                        |
| outz         |           | centered  | Outputs the player's z displacement                        |
| xmm          |           | centered  | Outputs the player's x position in mm used                 |
| zmm          |           | centered  | Outputs the player's z position in mm used                 |
| speedvector  | vec       | centered  | Outputs the player's speed vector                          |

if `centered` is a nonzero number, the output functions will display the number as an expression in terms of `centered`. For example, running `;s sj outvz` results in `Vz: 0.3274`, and running `;s sj outvz(0.3)` results in `Vz: 0.3 + 0.0274`. Keep in mind that the `centered` number will also be truncated by the simulation's precision.

### Arguments
Arguments affect only the function in which they are present.

Positional arguments are defined by their positions to one another. Keyworded arguments are given by `argument`​`=`​`value`.

Most movement functions have the positonal args `duration, rotation`, which default to 1 and the player's default rotation, respectively. Many functions include default values for arguments like inertia that can be overriden to provide custom behavior.

| Argument  | Alias(es) | Effect                                     |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| duration  | dur, t    | Duration of the action                     |
| rotation  | rot, r    | The player's rotation                      |
| slip      | s         | Ground slipperiness                        |
| airborne  | air       | Determines whether the player is airborne  |
| sprinting | sprint    | Determines whether the player is sprinting |
| sneaking  | sneak, sn | Determines whether the player is sneaking  |
| jumping   | jump      | Determines whether the player is jumping   |
| speed     | spd       | Determines the player's speed level.       |
| slowness  | slow      | Determines the player's slowness level.    |

Adding arguments to functions clearly not designed for them will produce unpredictable and/or impossible results. It is also good to know a few quirks to this system. In particular, any function that moves the player while airborne or inside water will ignore `slip`, `speed`, and `slowness`. Hence, running `;s sprintair(3, slip=4, slow=2)` is no different than `;s sprintair(3)`.

### The repeat function
The repeat function (or just `r` for short) lets you repeat a function or a series of functions multiple times.  
For example, `repeat(sprintjump(12) outz, 3)` is equivalent to `sj(12) outz sj(12) outz sj(12) outz`.
Simulations will time out if it takes too long to calculate.

### Comments
Anything delimited by `#` will be ignored. Hence, running `wj.s(12) w.s | # hello world sj(3) # sj(12)` is equivalent to running `wj.s(12) w.s | sj(12)`.
Comments are multiline.

## User-Defined Variables and Functions

Custom variables can be defined with the syntax `var(name, val)`.  
For example, you could define t=12 with `var(t, 12)`, then use the variable with `sprintjump(t)`.

Custom functions can be defined with the syntax `function(name, inputs, *args)`.  
For example, you could define `function(angled_3bc, -wj(duration, angle) -w(1, angle) | sj(duration, angle), duration, angle)`.  
You could then call this function with `angled_3bc(11, 0.0054)`

Functions and variables will persist across channels and servers until Mothball restarts.

## Input-based Functions

You may modify a movement function's keypresses with the syntax `function.keys`.  
For example, `sprint.wd(4, 10)` would sprint with WD for 4 ticks facing 10.

Prepending a function with `-` will invert the keypresses.  
For example, `-w(5)` walks backwards with S for 5 ticks, and `-s.wd(2)` will sprint backwarwds with S and A for 2 ticks.
For the sake of clarity and readability, it is recommended to only use the `-` syntax as an alternative to `<func>.s` (unless you're calculating movement resulting from glitches).

## Macros

MPK Mod macros can be made by adding the argumentless macro function anywhere in a command.  
For example, this simulates 1bm 5-1: `wj.sd(12, 35) w.sd(1, 35) sj.wa(1, 35) s45a(11) | sj45(14) b macro`  
You may also provide the macro function a name with macro(name)

Macros will not account for sprinting in air starting a tick late.

Cyv Client macros have a slightly different syntax than MPK Mod macros. As mothball only outputs MPK Mod macros, be sure to double check while converting the macro to Cyv's style.

## Optimization Functions

There are three optimization functions: `bwmm`, `inv`, and `speedreq`.  
They all behave similarly. First, they take a goal arg that they will optimize Z towards. Second, they take a strat to optimize. The function will find the speed required to meet the goal, then perform the strat that speed.

Here are a few examples!  
1bm 4.8175+0.5: `bwmm(1, sj45(12)) | sj45(10) zb`. This is a loop jump.  
2bm backwalled 4.125b with 3bc: `inv(2, sj | sa(11)) | sj45(11) zb`. Note that there's a `|` after the sj forward. This is because you're still moving backward before that tick, so it must be ignored.  
Finding the speed required for a 5 block, no 45: `sta speedreq(5, sj(12)) b`. Note the `sta` before the `speedreq`. This is to make the player start midair, since mothball usually assumes the player starts on the ground.
`speedreq` is also used for momentums with both a front and back wall. For example, a 3bm backwalled triple neo: `speedreq(3, sj | sa(11)) | sj(11) zmm(3)`. Note the `|` after the sj forward. As a bonus, using `zmm` helps check the offset for triple neos as well as any neo where distance is potentially a very important factor.
